Model two alleal mechanism. Selection acts on males (disruptive selection, selection against hybrids) Female preference modeled with separate parameters for preference for conspecifics, preference for hybrids, preference for heterospecifics.

They take already existing populations with mate discrimination and see what affect new mutations have. These mutations can be a "one alleal model" like where they increase preference regardless of which male the female prefers or more like a two alleal...

also develop a 1.5 alleal model where the two alleles act only in the background that they are supposed to and are neutral in the other background.

2 allele doesn't invade unless effect size is large. 1 allele model invades quite easily.}

Innovation rate/brain size/neocortex ratio is not correlated with climatic variability in primates{\ldots}

Brain size is correlated with the amount of seasonality in the diet, agreeing with the expensive brain hypothesis, however cognitive buffering also modulates it because larger brained primates experienced less variation in their diet than expected based on the environmental parameters.}

K lines carrying capacity

looked at size in different competition regimes (blocks) and different food level treatments. Saw that both lines grew the same. No directional selection. However among R lines the variance was much greater suggesting drift is important for this trait and not selection.}

Okay basically this is not "re-evolution". Looking at relatives which are direct developing you see the transient appearance of larval structuring during embryonic development. Therefore they don't re evolve these developmental programs they just elaborate on them to create the larval stage which was "lost".

Create dyad model with WEKA, later can incorporate a multi-agent model

multi-agent model (in Java) will call the BAYESnet in WEKA to update their outgoing actions. Each round they will make their "moves" i.e. their outward actions towards other agents. Each agent will record the amount of actions that it received and those received actions will make up the new social network statistics which will be fed into WEKA model for the next round.

Multi Agent Systems--{\&}gt; virtual groups and populations.

THINGS TO INCLUDE IN MODEL

SNA variables:
Eigenvector Centraility
Degree/Strength
Clustering Coefficient

Agent variables:
Sex
Territorial Status
Reproductive status (gravidity)
Size

All of the agents will evolve in the space and will behave according to certain rules. 

How do you know which individuals an agent will direct their actions towards? Is there any attributes that make them a more likely target? For example is NT aggression a parent variable of T on that NT?

the bayesnet will be modeled on individuals each individual's record will have behaviors they're putting out and what they're receiving.

With this model I'll be able to model both individual attributes and their effect}
